# 3D-Physics-Sandbox
This is my project submitting for #axiom.
This features a 3d sandbox which took me approximately 33 hours.
I was inspired by a game I used to play when i was 6 it was also a 3d phyics sandbox it was quite old pretty sure its like 13 years old today
but i learned a lot from it and thats the inspiration I used.
You can run it using the link attached I am using github pages to host it and it is my first ever website.
This is my first time submitting a project in hackclub and i spent a lot of hours on this far more than my usual attention span for sure.
It has 4 editors that are displayed on the homepage Cuboid, Sphere, Pyramid and Custom each editor has the ability to scale it using sliders maximum usually 5-10cm and 
you can also pick the color using the color picker.In the custom editor however you can pick the mass and the various different shapes showed in the list and 
I didnt even know half those shapes existed before I searched up cool 3d shapes(i know its not the best search prompt).
There are 2 simulators the flaot page which shows whether your object sinks or floats and you can change the density using the slider top left and 
the trampoline simulator it has a green disc where the shape collides and bounces of and its calculated assuming no wind etc so it is not pausible in real
life because there will always be external factors affecting but it is supposed to simulate what happoens in a closed of controlled environment.
This is also my first type using css, javascript and html i had to go through a ton of youtube tutorials but worth it definitely and I learned a lot about pwm 
how difficult coding is and that a lot of websites use javascript and that new software helps users withy no coding experience design a website its amazing what
tech can do!
